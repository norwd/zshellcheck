# Contributing to ZShellCheck

Thanks for helping improve ZShellCheck.
This guide covers the PR workflow, how to add a kata, and the local checks you should run before pushing.

For deeper internals (lexer/parser/AST design, release process, architecture diagrams), see the [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afadesigns/zshellcheck.git
cd zshellcheck
./install.sh
```

The installer builds from source when run inside the repo, or downloads the signed release binary otherwise.
See [Developer Guide — Getting Started](docs/DEVELOPER.md#getting-started) for prerequisites.

## Pull Request Workflow

1. **Sync `main`**
   ```bash
   git switch main
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. **Branch** with a conventional prefix (`feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`, `perf/`, `test/`, `ci/`):
   ```bash
   git switch -c fix/short-description
   ```
3. **Implement + test locally.** See [Local Checks](#local-checks) below.
4. **Commit** using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat: ZC#### — detect <pattern>`
   - `fix: ZC#### false positive on <case>`
   - `docs: update USER_GUIDE for inline directives`
   - `ci: tighten golangci timeout`
   - `chore: bump go-release action pin`
   - Commits are **GPG-signed**.
     `commit.gpgsign=true` or append `-S`.
5. **Push + PR:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch>
   gh pr create --fill
   ```
6. **Review:** CODEOWNERS (@afadesigns) must approve.
   All required checks (`test`, `security`, `sbom`) must pass.
   CI will reject unsigned commits.
7. **Merge:** maintainer squash-merges on green.

### Link issues
Use `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` in the PR body so the issue auto-closes on merge.

## Local Checks

Before pushing, run:

```bash
go test -count=1 ./...
/srv/tools/go/bin/golangci-lint run ./...
go vet ./...
```

Or run `pre-commit run --all-files` if you have `pre-commit` installed — the project ships `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` covering lint, format, tests, and a trace scan.

Fuzz tests are time-boxed; run them when touching lexer/parser:

```bash
go test -fuzz=FuzzLexer -fuzztime=10s ./pkg/lexer
go test -fuzz=FuzzParser -fuzztime=10s ./pkg/parser
```

## Adding a New Kata

A kata is a Zsh-specific detection rule.
Full scaffold + conventions live in the [Developer Guide — Creating a New Kata](docs/DEVELOPER.md#creating-a-new-kata).
Short form:

1. Pick the next ID: `ls pkg/katas/zc*.go | sort | tail -1`
2. Create `pkg/katas/zc<NNNN>.go` registering the kata.
3. Create `pkg/katas/katatests/zc<NNNN>_test.go` with valid + invalid fixtures.
4. Once committed, **fix — don't remove** a kata.
   Retire duplicates as no-op stubs (pattern: `ZC1018`, `ZC1022`).

### Kata Conventions

- **Zsh-specific only.** Reject generic POSIX-sh anti-patterns — ShellCheck covers those.
- **Severity required.** One of `SeverityError`, `SeverityWarning`, `SeverityInfo`, `SeverityStyle`.
  See [Severity Levels](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#severity-levels).
- **Never `panic()` in `Check`.** Use `ok`-checked type assertions.
  A kata panic kills the linter.
- **No duplicates.** Grep existing katas before writing a new one.
- **Backtick-quote shell syntax** in titles, descriptions, and messages.
  End sentences with a period.

### Adding an Auto-Fix

A kata becomes auto-fixable when the rewrite is **context-free, idempotent, and byte-exact**.
If any of those conditions fails, leave `Fix` nil and ship detection-only.

1. Set the `Fix` field on the kata struct:

   ```go
   RegisterKata(ast.SimpleCommandNode, Kata{
       ID:       "ZC#####",
       Title:    "...",
       Severity: SeverityWarning,
       Check:    checkZC#####,
       Fix:      fixZC#####,
   })
   ```

2. Implement `fixZC####(node ast.Node, v Violation, source []byte) []FixEdit` returning a slice of byte-span replacements.
   `FixEdit` carries 1-based `Line` + `Column`, byte `Length`, and the replacement string.
   `pkg/katas/fixutil.go` exposes helpers (`LineColToByteOffset`, etc.).
3. Re-confirm the rewrite is safe across whitespace, quoting, and trailing-comment variants.
   The fixer runs multi-pass (up to five) so nested rewrites can co-exist.
4. Add a fix-side test in `pkg/katas/katatests/zc####_test.go` covering at least one applied-edit case and one no-op case.
5. Re-run `go run ./internal/tools/gen-katas-md` to refresh `KATAS.md`.
   The new entry will report `Auto-fix: yes` and the summary count will increment.

Reference rewrite shapes already in the catalog:

| Pattern | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Token substitution (single byte span) | `ZC1002` `` `cmd` `` → `$(cmd)` |
| Identifier rename | `ZC1005` `which` → `whence` |
| Command + flag collapse | `ZC1355` `echo -E …` → `print -r …` |
| Parameter-name rename | `ZC1313` `$BASH_ALIASES` → `$aliases` |
| Quote-insertion around an expansion | `ZC1075` `rm -rf $var` → `rm -rf "$var"` |

If your rewrite doesn't fit one of these shapes, document the new pattern under this list in the same PR.

## Helping with distribution

Two install channels are explicitly community-submittable — the project benefits from a third party filing the upstream PR rather than the author self-submitting.

- **Homebrew (homebrew-core)** — third-party submissions face a lower notability bar (≥75 stars / ≥30 forks / ≥30 watchers) than self-submissions (≥225 stars / ≥90 forks / ≥90 watchers).
  When the repo crosses the lower bar, the `homebrew-eligibility` workflow opens a tracking issue.
  A community member is welcome to file the new-formula PR against [`Homebrew/homebrew-core`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) at that point — credit goes to the submitter in the PR.
  The author will not self-submit until the higher bar is met, to keep the path of least resistance open.
- **AUR** (`zshellcheck-bin`) — anyone with an AUR account can host the package; coordination happens through an issue tagged `distribution`.
  Goreleaser writes the `PKGBUILD` automatically when the project's release workflow has the credentials, but a community-maintained AUR package is welcome until that lands.

## Security

Do not file vulnerabilities as public issues.
See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the reporting process.
