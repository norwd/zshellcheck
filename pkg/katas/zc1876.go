			"`patch.crates-io` override that only exists locally ends up on crates.io " +
			"under the same version users see on GitHub. This is irreversible — once a " +
			"version is uploaded it cannot be replaced, only yanked. Commit first and " +
			"publish from a clean checkout; if you truly must publish from a dirty tree, " +
