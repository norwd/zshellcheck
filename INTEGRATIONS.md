# Integrations

ZShellCheck is verified against the script trees of widely used Zsh integrations.
Every release runs a parse and lint sweep over each — no panics, no crashes, deterministic output.
The list grows with every release.

## How the sweep runs

Each release tag triggers a parse and lint pass over every integration listed in the **Featured** and per-category tables.
Each pass produces:

- `parse_errors` — total parser failures across the integration.
- `violations` — total kata hits across all severities.

When the sweep surfaces a bug, a GitHub issue is filed, a PR fixes it, and the integration stays in the matrix on every subsequent release.

## Adding an integration

To get a popular Zsh integration covered, open an issue tagged `integration` with the repo URL and a short note on what it covers.
The next sweep adds it and the changelog entry credits the request.
