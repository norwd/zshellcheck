## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Auto-fix coverage expanded to 102 katas (+35 since 1.0.15).** All new fixes are deterministic, idempotent, and byte-exact outside the rewritten span. The TIER 2 batch added 12 span-aware / multi-edit / token-strip rewrites on top of the original 23 TIER 1 candidates:
  - **Pipeline collapse:**
    - `ZC1146` — `cat F | sed/awk/sort/head/tail` → `tool ... F` (drops `cat F |`, appends `F` to the right side).
    - `ZC1190` — `grep -v p1 | grep -v p2` → `grep -v -e p1 -e p2` (single-grep collapse).
  - **Flag insertion (command-level):**
    - `ZC1230` — `ping URL` → `ping -c 4 URL`.
    - `ZC1255` — `curl URL` → `curl -L URL` (HTTP-redirect follow).
    - `ZC1773` — `xargs CMD` → `xargs -r CMD` (skip empty-input invocation).
  - **Flag insertion (subcommand-level / positional anchor):**
    - `ZC1257` — `docker stop X` → `docker stop -t 10 X`.
    - `ZC1268` — `du -sh *` → `du -sh -- *` (`--` end-of-options before first non-flag).
  - **Token-strip (whitespace-aware delete):**
    - `ZC1238` — `docker exec -it …` → `docker exec …`.
    - `ZC1239` — `kubectl exec -it …` → `kubectl exec …`.
  - **IdentifierNode renames (Bash → Zsh):**
    - `ZC1319` — `$BASH_ARGC` → `$#`.
    - `ZC1320` — `$BASH_ARGV` → `$argv`.
  - **Assignment-LHS rename:**
    - `ZC1380` — `export HISTIGNORE=…` → `export HISTORY_IGNORE=…`.
- **Auto-fix coverage (TIER 1 batch, +23):** All new fixes are deterministic, idempotent, and byte-exact outside the rewritten span.
  - **Backtick / brace-range aliases (share existing fix shape):**
    - `ZC1015` — backticks → `$(...)` (alias of `ZC1002`).
    - `ZC1276` — `seq M N` → `{M..N}` brace range (alias of `ZC1061`).
  - **Single-token command-name renames:**
    - `ZC1034` — `which` → `command -v` (ExpressionStatement-position rewrite).
    - `ZC1271` — `which` → `command -v` (SimpleCommand-position rewrite).
    - `ZC1191` — `clear` → `print -rn $'\e[2J\e[H'` (avoids the external process; the `-rn` form keeps the rewrite idempotent against `ZC1017`/`ZC1118`).
    - `ZC1202` — `ifconfig` → `ip addr`.
    - `ZC1203` — `netstat` → `ss`.
    - `ZC1216` — `nslookup` → `host`.
    - `ZC1501` — `docker-compose` → `docker compose` (hyphen → space subcommand).
    - `ZC1565` — `whereis` / `locate` / `mlocate` / `plocate` → `command -v`.
    - `ZC1155` — `which -a` → `whence -a` (name swap; `-a` flag preserved).
  - **Single-character / two-token flag swaps:**
    - `ZC1260` — `git branch -D` → `git branch -d`.
    - `ZC1235` — `git push -f` → `git push --force-with-lease`.
  - **Two-edit / span-collapsing rewrites:**
    - `ZC1334` — `type -p` / `type -P` → `whence -p` (collapses both name and flag in one span so it wins over `ZC1064`'s narrower `type` → `command -v`).
    - `ZC1411` — `enable -n NAME` → `disable NAME` (drops the flag, renames the verb).
    - `ZC1219` — `wget -O- URL` / `wget -qO- URL` → `curl -fsSL URL` (single-span rewrite of name + flag).
    - `ZC1448` — `apt install` (no `-y`) inserts ` -y` after the command name; `ZC1213` continues to handle `apt-get` so the two katas do not double-insert.
    - `ZC1163` — `grep PAT | head -1` (or `head -n1`) → `grep -m 1 PAT` (pipeline collapse).
  - **IdentifierNode parameter renames:**
    - `ZC1297` — `$BASH_SOURCE` → `${(%):-%x}`.
  - **Echo / print / printf argument-string substitutions:**
    - `ZC1377` — `BASH_ALIASES` → `aliases` inside string args.
    - `ZC1378` — `DIRSTACK` → `dirstack` inside string args.
    - `ZC1383` — `TIMEFORMAT` → `TIMEFMT` inside string / export args.
    - `ZC1394` — `$BASH` (not part of `$BASH_*`) → `$ZSH_NAME` inside string args.

### Changed
- `ZC1005`'s `which` → `whence` rewrite now yields `command -v` for the bare-statement case because the new `ZC1034` fix arrives ahead in walk order. Inside backticks / `$(...)`, `whence` still wins because the parent `ExpressionStatement` is absent.
- `ZC1263`'s `apt` → `apt-get` rewrite for `apt install` now runs alongside `ZC1448`'s `-y` insertion, producing `apt-get -y install ...` in a single pass.

## [1.0.15] - 2026-04-25

### Breaking
- **Inline directive renamed `# zshellcheck disable=…` → `# noka`.**
  The legacy form is no longer recognised — every silenced violation needs its directive rewritten.
  Three forms remain available:
    - `cmd  # noka`              — silences every kata on this line.
    - `cmd  # noka: ZC1234`      — silences one kata on this line.
    - `cmd  # noka: ZC1234, ZC1075` — multiple, comma- or space-separated.
  Standalone `# noka` directives still apply to the next non-blank code line; placed at file tail with no code after them, they apply file-wide.
  Rationale: shorter (18 vs 30 chars), distinctive ("no kata"), aligns with the python ecosystem's `# noqa` convention.
  Refactored cleanly while the project is still early — no fork-side migration to coordinate.

### Added
- **`-no-banner` CLI flag.** Suppresses the startup banner.
  Useful for CI runs, scripted invocations, and embedding zshellcheck output inside other tools where the banner is noise.
  Banner remains the default for interactive use.
- **Auto-fix coverage expanded to 67 katas.** The first-wave shipped 3 (`ZC1002`, `ZC1005`, `ZC1092`); the registry now ships rewrites for parameter-name renames (`$BASH_ALIASES` → `$aliases`, `$BASH_REMATCH` → `$match`, `$BASH_VERSION` → `$ZSH_VERSION`, `$TIMEFORMAT` → `$TIMEFMT`, `$BASH_CMDS` → `$commands`, ZSH array helpers, etc.), command/flag rewrites (`echo -E` → `print -r`, `read -a` → `read -A`), and several modernisations across the ZC1300 series.
- **Demo recording.** `docs/assets/demo.gif` showcases the lint → diff → fix → re-lint loop on a sample script, embedded in the README.
  Source tape at `docs/assets/demo.tape` for reproducible re-renders via [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs).
- **CLI banner refreshed.** Terminal-art rendering of the project logo replaces the prior block-letter ASCII.
  Tagline matches the project slogan: `The quiet linter for a quiet shell.`
- **`KATAS.md` shows fix coverage.** Generator now emits an `Auto-fix: yes/no` line per entry and a `with auto-fix` row in the summary table.
- **`--help` redesign.** Flags grouped by intent (OUTPUT / FILTER / AUTO-FIX / DIAGNOSTICS), six-entry EXAMPLES block, ANSI colour gated on TTY + `NO_COLOR`.
- **Windows installer (`install.ps1`).** PowerShell 5.1+ compatible, mirrors `install.sh`: SHA-256 + cosign verification, user-scoped install into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\zshellcheck\bin`, clean `-Uninstall` reversal.
- **Linux native packages.** Goreleaser `nfpms:` block emits signed `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.apk` artifacts on every tag, alongside the existing tarballs.
- **Multi-arch Docker image.** `FROM scratch`, ≈ 2 MB, published to `ghcr.io/afadesigns/zshellcheck` for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. Manifest signed with cosign.
- **`INSTALL.md` canonical install guide.** Single source of truth split into macOS / Windows / Linux / Cross-platform sections with explicit uninstall paths everywhere.
- **`INTEGRATIONS.md` at repo root.** Per-project tables (frameworks, plugin managers, tooling, plugins, prompts) plus the targeted-next list.
- **Homebrew-eligibility tracker.** New weekly workflow opens a tracking issue when stargazers / forks / watchers cross the third-party homebrew-core notability threshold.

### Changed
- **Column pointer character.** Lint output now uses `↑` (U+2191) under the offending column instead of `^`.
  Matches the convention modern compilers (rustc, swiftc) use when pointing to a column.
- **Multi-pass `-fix`.** `applyFixesUntilStable` now loops `fix.Apply` while `collectEdits` keeps producing edits, capped at five passes.
  Nested rewrites (e.g.
  `` `which git` `` → `$(whence git)`) resolve in a single `-fix` invocation.
- **Fix summary footer.** Multi-file `-fix` runs now print `fix summary: N edit(s) across M file(s) (scanned K)` to stderr.
  Single-file invocations stay silent for backward compatibility.
- **Repo description + homepage.** Synced to the locked README slogan/subheader; homepage points at the repo root.
- **README structure.** New quick-link nav row above the fold, demo GIF replaces the prior Katas-at-a-glance teaser, Install section rebuilt around the three primary channels (macOS/Linux, Windows, Go), Integrations table trimmed to a featured spotlight + link to `INTEGRATIONS.md`, Documentation table reordered with `INSTALL.md` and `INTEGRATIONS.md` added.
- **All top-level docs reflowed to semantic line breaks.** One sentence per source line. Rendered output unchanged (CommonMark soft breaks); diff hygiene improved.

### Fixed
- **Typed-nil `ast.Node` handling.** Guarded `Walk` against typed-nil interface values so downstream visitors no longer panic on partially-constructed trees produced by parser recovery paths.
- **32 kata nil-guards.** Hardened `*ast.Identifier` dereferences across ZC1122, ZC1191, and the ZC1297–ZC1333 series so external projects that produce nil identifier values no longer crash the linter.
- **Parser compat.** Routed `cmd --flag arg` through the simple-command path (refactored 23 mangled-name katas onto `FlagArgPosition`); added bracket-cond glob-alt literal support; fixed inner `$()` `RPAREN` containment via `consumedParenTerminator`; multi-line `$(…)` newline drain; case-pattern glob-alt label advance.

## [1.0.14] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Auto-fixer core.** New `pkg/fix` package applies per-kata `Fix` edits to source files.
  Handles 1-based line/column to byte-offset resolution, conflict resolution when edits overlap (outer span wins, inner picked up on rerun), and a built-in unified-diff renderer for preview mode.
- **CLI fix flags** — `-fix` (apply in place), `-diff` (preview as unified diff), `-dry-run` (with `-fix`, report without writing).
  File permissions are preserved across in-place rewrites.
- **Kata `Fix` hook.** `Kata` now carries an optional `Fix func(ast.Node, Violation, []byte) []FixEdit`.
  Checks that declare a Fix participate in auto-fixing; those that do not continue to lint-only.
- **First-wave Fix coverage:**
  - `ZC1002` — `` `cmd` `` to `$(cmd)`.
  - `ZC1005` — `which` to `whence`.
  - `ZC1092` — `echo` to `print -r --` for the no-flag form.
- **Zsh-ecosystem compatibility harness.** New `scripts/test-zsh-compat.sh` clones a corpus of well-known Zsh projects (oh-my-zsh, powerlevel10k, prezto, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting, zsh-completions, spaceship-prompt) into `testdata/external-corpora/` (git-ignored) and reports parser errors plus violation summaries.

### Changed
- `CheckAndFix` registry method added alongside `Check` so the walker can collect violations and their fix edits in a single pass.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Parser**: bare `$+name` / `$+name[key]` inside `(( … ))` no longer errors with `expected next token to be IDENT, got + instead`.
  Equivalent shape to the working `${+name[key]}` path.
  (#1047)
- **Parser**: `(( A )) && (( B ))` / `||` chains (and mixed) no longer error with `no prefix parse function for && found`.
  Logical operators after an arithmetic command now parse into a normal `InfixExpression`.
  (#1047)

### Changed
- `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` — `language: go` → `language: golang`, the canonical pre-commit language identifier.
  Fixes installation under `prek`.
  (#1046)

## [1.0.12] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- `action.yml` — extend `name` to `ZshellCheck v1` (the `ZshellCheck` form from v1.0.11 still collided with an existing Marketplace registry entry).
  The action identifier (`afadesigns/zshellcheck@vX.Y.Z`) is unchanged.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- `action.yml` — rename `name` from `ZShellCheck` to `ZshellCheck` (lowercase `h`).
  Marketplace requires a unique action name; the original capitalization collided with an existing registry entry.
  The action identifier (`afadesigns/zshellcheck@vX.Y.Z`) is unchanged.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-04-20

**Versioning switch.** The kata-count formula (MAJOR = count/1000,
MINOR = (count%1000)/100, PATCH = count%100) retires here.
Going
forward ZShellCheck follows standard [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).
`pkg/version/version.go` is now hand-maintained; `scripts/update-version.sh`,
`scripts/HOTFIX`, and the `update-version` pre-commit hook are removed.
The `tag-release` workflow no longer auto-bumps PATCH on every main
push — tags are cut manually.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-04-20

Hotfix rollup for every fix merged between the v1.0.0 tag and the
GitHub Marketplace debut.
No new katas — kata count stays at 1000.

### Added
- **Inline `# zshellcheck disable=…` directives** — suppress katas
  per-line (trailing comment), per-next-line (standalone comment above
  code), or file-wide (standalone comment with no following code).
  Multiple IDs may be comma- or whitespace-separated.
Merges with the
  config-level `disabled_katas` list.
(#127)
- **XDG Base Directory support** — `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zshellcheck/config.{yml,yaml}`
  is now merged with `~/.zshellcheckrc` and `./.zshellcheckrc`, with the
  project-local file winning.
(#309)
- **`scripts/HOTFIX` offset file** — tracks monotonic patch-release
  bumps so hotfix releases can ship between kata additions without
  colliding with the kata-count formula.

### Fixed
- **Parser panic on `dd if=src of=dst`** — the lexer now demotes
  keyword tokens to `IDENT` when immediately followed by `=`, so
  `if=`, `of=`, etc. parse as ordinary key=value argument pairs.
(#435)
- **`elif` chain mis-nesting** — `parseIfStatement` now terminates the
  consequence block on `ELIF` and builds a right-nested `IfStatement`
  chain, fixing false-positives on multi-branch conditionals.
(#126)
- **Parser crash on `/dev/sdX` literals** in arithmetic and redirection
  positions.
(#347)
- **14 duplicate katas retired** as no-op stubs (ZC1022–1029, 1033,
  1035, 1018, 1019, 1277, 1278).
Canonical detections remain in the
  surviving sibling IDs; retired IDs still parse in `.zshellcheckrc`
  so legacy configs keep working.
(#341–#345)
- **5 overlapping kata pairs narrowed** — ZC1441 skips when
  `--volumes` is present (ZC1545 owns that case); ZC1978 narrows to
  `tftp` (ZC1200 owns `ftp`); ZC1327 drops `-c`/`-d` (ZC1487 owns);
  ZC1826 drops numeric modes (ZC1892 owns); ZC1999 rewritten as a
  typo-detector pointing at ZC1934 `AUTO_NAME_DIRS`.
- **10 Style katas rebalanced to Warning** — ZC1075, 1078, 1079, 1084,
  1085, 1090, 1136, 1139, 1141, 1258.
These flag patterns with real
  correctness or safety impact, not cosmetic preference.
(#346)

### CI
- **OSV-Scanner** workflow drops the removed `--skip-git` flag that
  OSV-Scanner v2 rejects; PRs no longer pre-fail on the vulnerability
  scan step.
- **`golangci-lint-action` pinned at v6.5.2** until the v1→v2 config
  migration lands — avoids surfacing ~20 pre-existing `staticcheck`
  QF1001-QF1003 findings that block unrelated Dependabot bumps.

### Documentation
- USER_GUIDE gains an **Inline Disable Directives** section covering
  the three directive forms.
- Author identity corrected across CITATION.cff, SECURITY.md, and
  CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md — contact email is now `github@afadesign.co`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-20

**1000 Katas milestone.** The kata-count formula (MAJOR = count/1000,
MINOR = (count%1000)/100, PATCH = count%100) now resolves to exactly
`1.0.0`.
This is the first stable release of ZShellCheck, targeted at
the GitHub Marketplace launch.

### Added
- **665 new Katas** bringing the total from 335 (v0.3.35) to **1000**
  (ZC1339 through ZC2003).
Highlights:
  - **Zsh semantics & `setopt` subtleties** — `PROMPT_SUBST`,
    `GLOBAL_RCS`, `POSIX_IDENTIFIERS`, `CHASE_DOTS`, `SH_FILE_EXPANSION`,
    `CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES`, `REMATCH_PCRE`, `KSH_TYPESET`, `BRACE_CCL`,
    `CSH_NULLCMD`, `AUTO_NAMED_DIRS`, `EVAL_LINENO`, `KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT`,
    `HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS`, `HIST_FCNTL_LOCK`, `BG_NICE`, and many more.
  - **Storage & filesystem safety** — `zpool import -f`/`export -f`,
    `dmsetup remove_all`, `losetup -P`/`kpartx -a`/`partprobe`,
    `sgdisk -Z`/`-o`, `lvreduce -f`/`-y`, `exportfs -au`.
  - **Kernel/devices** — `udevadm trigger --action=remove`,
    `tpm2_clear`, `ipcrm -a`, `unshare -U`/`-r`.
  - **Platform ops** — `crictl rmi -a`/`rm -af`,
    `kubectl taint nodes …:NoExecute`, `dnf/yum versionlock add`.
  - **Shell hygiene** — `zsh -f`/`-d` bypassing startup files,
    `exec -a NAME` masking `argv[0]`, `touch -d`/`-t`/`-r` timestamp
    rewrite, `nsupdate -y` TSIG-in-argv, `openssl passwd -crypt`/`-1`/`-apr1`,
    `ftp`/`tftp` plaintext, `pkexec` script elevation.
- **Test triplet per kata** — `pkg/katas/katatests/zc####_test.go` with
  valid + invalid cases across every new ID.
- **Misspell ignore-words entry for `exportfs`** — prevents false
  positives on legitimate NFS-tool references.

### Changed
- README, USER_GUIDE, REFERENCE, ROADMAP, CITATION.cff, and the
  `zshellcheck(1)` man page updated for v1.0.0 and the 1000-kata total.
- `-severity`, `--no-color`, `--version`, and `-format sarif` now
  documented in the man page.

### Documentation
- CHANGELOG gains this 1.0.0 section covering the ZC1339–ZC2003 range.
- ROADMAP marks the 250, 500, and 1000-kata milestones complete and
  advances the LSP / auto-fixer / plugin work into the 1.x bucket.

## [0.3.35] - 2026-04-17

**Public beta.** First release with successfully built, signed, and
attested binaries.
The kata-count formula now maps correctly to the
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` scheme (335 katas → 0.3.35); prior tag series was
produced before the release pipeline was functional and contained no
published artifacts.

### Added
- **169 new Katas** (ZC1170 through ZC1338) spanning: Zsh built-in
  preferences over external commands, parameter-expansion
  alternatives to `cut`/`sed`/`tr`/`sort`, Bash-ism detection for
  portability, and git/docker/grep flag recommendations.
- **SBOM workflow**: weekly SPDX + CycloneDX generation, attested on
  main for SLSA-aligned build metadata.
- **OSV-Scanner**: daily scheduled scan of Go module dependencies,
  SARIF uploaded to Security tab.
- **Nightly fuzz**: 5-minute budget per lexer/parser target with
  corpus caching and failing-corpus artifact upload.
- **Release pipeline**: Syft for SBOM in archives, Cosign keyless
  signing, `actions/attest-build-provenance` for SLSA provenance,
  locked to goreleaser `~> v2`.

### Changed
- **Codecov gate**: raised project + patch targets from 80% to 95%.
- **Release archives**: now include man page, Zsh and Bash shell
  completions, and CHANGELOG alongside LICENSE and README.
- **Label taxonomy**: removed duplicates (`documentation`,
  `enhancement`), renamed `starter` to `good first issue` for
  GitHub discoverability, added severity/component/topic/status
  labels.

### Fixed
- **install.sh** (#311): graceful HTTP error handling when
  `/releases/latest` returns 404, with `/tags` fallback; explicit
  error message when no tag can be resolved instead of silent exit.
- **Release workflow**: installed missing Syft and Cosign on the
  runner; locked goreleaser-action version syntax to `~> v2` to
  avoid ambiguous `latest`.
- **GoReleaser config**: updated `archives.format_overrides.format`
  to the plural `formats` key per goreleaser v2.

### Known Issues
Filed during release prep for community resolution:
- **#341-#345**: duplicate kata detections (ZC1038/ZC1093,
  ZC1005/ZC1019, ZC1009/ZC1018/ZC1278, ZC1108/ZC1277, and a 10-kata
  cluster in ZC1022-ZC1029 + ZC1033/ZC1035).
- **#346**: 11 Style-severity katas likely better categorised as
  Warning (quoting defects, `rm -rf`, `curl | sh`, `source` with URL).
- **#347**: parser crashes on common Zsh constructs
  (`for...in...do...done`, `||`) — reduces detection fidelity on
  real-world `.zshrc` files.

## [0.1.66] - 2026-03-30
