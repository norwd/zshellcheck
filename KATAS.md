<summary><strong>ZC1001</strong>: Use ${} for array element access <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh, accessing array elements using `$array[index]` can sometimes behave unexpectedly or be misinterpreted in complex expansions. The more explicit and safer syntax is `${array[index]}`, which clearly delimits the array access from surrounding text or other expansions. This ensures the correct element is accessed, especially when dealing with nested expansions or when the array name might be followed by characters that could be part of a variable name.

### Bad Example

```zsh
my_array=(alpha beta gamma)
echo $my_array[2]suffix # Might output "beta" then "suffix", or error
```

### Good Example

```zsh
my_array=(alpha beta gamma)
echo "The second element is ${my_array[2]}."
## Expected output: The second element is beta.

## Or, to safely concatenate:
echo "${my_array[2]}suffix" # Clearly outputs "betasuffix"
```

### Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1001` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.

<summary><strong>ZC1002</strong>: Use $(...) instead of backticks <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Backticks (`` `command` ``) for command substitution are an older, deprecated syntax with several significant disadvantages compared to `$(command)`. The `$(...)` form is the modern, preferred, and **POSIX-standard** way to perform command substitution in Zsh and other compatible shells. Preferring `$(...)` offers substantial benefits:

*   **Readability and Clarity:** `$(...)` clearly delimits the command being substituted, improving visual parsing and understanding of the script's logic.
*   **Arbitrary Nesting:** `$(...)` allows for arbitrary nesting of command substitutions without complex and error-prone backslash escaping. Backticks require cumbersome escaping (e.g., `` `echo \`date\`` ``) for nesting, which quickly becomes unmanageable.
*   **Reduced Ambiguity:** Backticks can sometimes be ambiguous with string literals or glob patterns, leading to unexpected behavior. `$(...)` avoids this ambiguity.
*   **Robustness:** Scripts using `$(...)` are generally more robust and less prone to subtle parsing errors across different shell environments or with complex inputs.

Adopting `$(...)` consistently leads to more readable, robust, and portable Zsh scripts.

### Bad Example

```zsh
## Old-style backticks
file_count=`ls | wc -l`
timestamp=`date +"%Y-%m-%d"`

## Difficult and error-prone nesting with backticks
nested_output=`echo \`date\``
```

### Good Example

```zsh
## Modern and clear command substitution
file_count=$(ls | wc -l)
timestamp=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")

## Easy and readable nesting with $(...)
nested_output=$(echo $(date))
```

### Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1002` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.

<summary><strong>ZC1003</strong>: Use `((...))` for arithmetic comparisons instead of `[` or `test` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

For pure **integer arithmetic comparisons** in Zsh, `((...))` provides a more natural, C-style syntax and often better performance and robustness than `[` or `test`. The `[[...]]` construct also supports arithmetic evaluation with `((...))`, but for direct integer comparisons, `((...))` is more idiomatic and efficient. Using `[` or `test` for arithmetic comparisons relies on external commands or string evaluation, which can be slower, less type-safe (as it treats numbers as strings), and prone to subtle quoting or parsing issues.

### Bad Example

```zsh
a=10; b=5
if [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]; then echo "a > b"; fi  # Relies on external `test` or `[` command
if test "$a" -le "$b"; then echo "a <= b"; fi # String comparison, potential issues with non-integers or edge cases
```

### Good Example

```zsh
a=10; b=5
if (( a > b )); then echo "a > b"; fi      # Direct integer arithmetic comparison
if (( a <= b )); then echo "a <= b"; fi   # Clearer, more performant, no quoting needed
```

### Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1003` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.

<summary><strong>ZC1004</strong>: Use `return` instead of `exit` in functions <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Using `exit` in a function terminates the entire shell, which is often unintended in interactive sessions or sourced scripts. Use `return` to exit the function.

### Bad Example

```zsh
my_func() {
  if [[ -z $1 ]]: then
    exit 1 # Kills the shell!
  fi
}
```

### Good Example

```zsh
my_func() {
  if [[ -z $1 ]]: then
    return 1
  fi
}
```

### Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1004` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.

<details>
<summary><strong>ZC1005</strong>: Use `whence` instead of `which` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh, `whence` is a built-in command that is significantly more powerful and accurate than the external `which` utility. `whence` reports exactly how Zsh will interpret a command, including whether it's an alias, a function, a built-in, or an executable found in your `PATH`. This provides a complete and reliable picture of command resolution within your current Zsh environment.

`which`, on the other hand, is an external utility that only searches your `PATH` for executable files. It will not show aliases, functions, or built-ins, which can lead to confusion or incorrect assumptions about which command will actually be executed by Zsh.

### Bad Example

```zsh
which ls    # Might show /bin/ls, but 'ls' could be an alias like 'ls --color=auto'
which my_zsh_function # Will not find Zsh functions
```

### Good Example

```zsh
whence ls   # Shows if 'ls' is an alias, function, or executable
whence -c ls # Provides more verbose, shell-like output (e.g., 'ls is alias ls --color=auto')
whence my_zsh_function # Correctly identifies Zsh functions
```

### Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1005` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.

<details>
<summary><strong>ZC1006</strong>: Prefer `[[` over `test` for tests <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh, `[[...]]` is a more powerful, safer, and idiomatic conditional construct than the traditional `test` command or single brackets `[...]`. The primary advantages of `[[...]]` include:

*   **Intelligent Word Splitting and Globbing:** Unlike `[` or `test`, `[[...]]` does not perform word splitting or pathname expansion (globbing) on unquoted variables, avoiding many common pitfalls and unexpected behaviors. This means you generally don't need to quote variables within `[[...]]` unless you specifically want literal string matching for patterns that might otherwise be interpreted as globs.
*   **Zsh-Specific Features:** It supports Zsh-specific features like regular expression matching (`=~`), globbing with extended patterns (`==`), and compound conditions (`&&`, `||`).
*   **Built-in Efficiency:** `[[...]]` is a keyword, not an external command, making it often faster and more efficient.

Using `test` or `[` requires meticulous quoting of variables to prevent unintended word splitting and pathname expansion, which can lead to bugs, security vulnerabilities, or simply incorrect logic. For arithmetic comparisons, `((...))` is generally preferred (see [[Katas/ZC1000-ZC1099/ZC1003 | ZC1003]]).

### Bad Example

```zsh
my_var="foo bar"
if [ -n $my_var ]; then echo "This might split into two arguments"; fi
## Expected to fail if $my_var contains spaces, or behave unexpectedly if it expands to a file glob.

file="my file.txt"
if [ -f $file ]; then echo "File exists"; fi # Will fail if 'my file.txt' is split

if test "$str1" = "$str2"; then echo "Strings are equal"; fi # Correctly quoted, but `[[...]]` is still preferred
```

### Good Example

```zsh
my_var="foo bar"
if [[ -n $my_var ]]; then echo "Correctly handles spaces and globs"; fi
## No quotes needed for $my_var, `[[...]]` handles it correctly.

file="my file.txt"
if [[ -f $file ]]; then echo "File exists"; fi # Safely handles spaces in file names

if [[ "$str1" = "$str2" ]]; then echo "Strings are equal"; fi

## Zsh-specific regex matching
if [[ "hello world" =~ "hello (.*)" ]]; then echo "Regex match!"; fi
```

### Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1006` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.

<summary><strong>ZC1007</strong>: Avoid using `chmod 777` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Setting file or directory permissions to `777` (read, write, execute for owner, group, and others) is a significant security risk. It grants unrestricted access to everyone on the system, which can lead to:

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Confidential files can be read by anyone.
*   **Unauthorized Modification:** Files can be altered or deleted by any user.
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** Executable files or scripts can be run by unauthorized individuals, potentially compromising the system.

Best practice dictates adhering to the **principle of least privilege**, meaning you should assign only the minimum necessary permissions. Here are recommended secure alternatives:

*   **For Directories:**
    *   `775` (rwx for owner/group, rx for others): Common for shared directories where group members need to create/delete files, but others only need to read/traverse.
    *   `770` (rwx for owner/group, no access for others): Stricter for sensitive shared directories.
    *   `755` (rwx for owner, rx for group/others): Standard for public web directories or user home directories.
*   **For Files:**
    *   `664` (rw for owner/group, r for others): Common for shared data files.
    *   `660` (rw for owner/group, no access for others): Stricter for sensitive shared files.
    *   `644` (rw for owner, r for group/others): Standard for configuration files or publicly readable data.
    *   `755` (rwx for owner, rx for group/others): Only for executable scripts.

### Bad Example

```zsh
chmod 777 sensitive_script.sh # Grants execute to everyone
chmod -R 777 public_html/     # Makes all files and subdirectories writable by everyone
```

### Good Example

```zsh
chmod 755 executable_script.zsh # Executable for owner, readable/executable for group and others
chmod 644 config.yaml          # Readable for everyone, writable only by owner
chmod -R 775 shared_project_data/ # Shared directory: group members can modify, others can read/traverse
```

### Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1007` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.

<summary><strong>ZC1008</strong>: Use `$(())` for arithmetic operations <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh, `$(())` is the preferred and most idiomatic syntax for **arithmetic expansion**. It allows for direct C-style arithmetic evaluation, returning the result of the expression without requiring external commands or explicit variable assignments for the result. Compared to alternatives like `expr` or `let`:

*   **Conciseness & Integration:** `$(())` is more compact and integrates seamlessly into other command substitutions or variable assignments.
*   **Efficiency:** It's a built-in shell feature, making it generally more efficient than invoking an external command like `expr`.
*   **Clarity:** It clearly signals an arithmetic context, improving script readability.

Using `expr` involves executing an external command, which adds overhead and can be less efficient for frequent operations. `let` is a built-in that performs arithmetic and assigns the result to a shell variable, but it doesn't directly return a value for use in pipelines or other command contexts, making `$(())` more versatile for expansion.

### Bad Example

```zsh
## Using expr (external command, less efficient)
val_expr=$(expr 10 + 5)
echo "Result from expr: $val_expr"

## Using let (assigns, doesn't return for expansion)
x=5; y=3
let "sum = x + y"
echo "Result from let: $sum"
```

### Good Example

```zsh
## Using $((...)) for direct arithmetic expansion
val_arith=$(( 10 + 5 ))
echo "Result from arithmetic expansion: $val_arith"

x=5; y=3
sum_arith=$(( x + y ))
echo "Result from arithmetic expansion: $sum_arith"

## Example in a conditional context
if (( a > b )); then
  echo "a is greater than b"
fi
```

### Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1008` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.

<summary><strong>ZC1009</strong>: Use `((...))` for C-style arithmetic <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh, the `((...))` construct is specifically designed for performing **C-style integer arithmetic evaluation and comparisons**. This is a powerful and efficient built-in mechanism to handle arithmetic directly within the shell, offering features like variable assignment, increment/decrement operators, and various logical/bitwise operations.

Key aspects of `((...))`:

*   **Conditional Context:** When used in a conditional context (e.g., `if (( ... ))`), `((...))` returns an exit status of `0` (true) if the arithmetic result is non-zero, and `1` (false) if the result is zero. This makes it ideal for conditional logic based on arithmetic.
*   **Efficiency:** As a built-in feature, it is generally more efficient than invoking external utilities like `expr`.
*   **Conciseness:** It provides a clean, C-like syntax for arithmetic operations.

This Kata promotes using `((...))` for arithmetic contexts where its **exit status** is relevant (e.g., in `if` or `while` statements) or for direct C-style assignments/increments. For cases where you need the **result of an arithmetic expression** as a value (e.g., to assign to another variable or use in a command substitution), the arithmetic expansion `$(())` is more appropriate (see [[Katas/ZC1000-ZC1099/ZC1008 | ZC1008]]).

### Bad Example

```zsh
## Using expr for a conditional check (external command, inefficient)
if expr $a + $b > /dev/null; then echo "Sum is non-zero"; fi

## Using let for incrementing (less idiomatic for C-style operation)
let i=i+1

## Performing comparison with [ (string comparison, error-prone)
if [ "$count" -lt 10 ]; then echo "Count is less than 10"; fi
```

### Good Example

```zsh
## Using ((...)) for a conditional check based on arithmetic result
if (( a + b )); then echo "Sum is non-zero"; fi

## Using ((...)) for C-style increment/decrement
(( i++ ))
(( --j ))

## Using ((...)) for arithmetic comparison in a conditional context
count=5
if (( count < 10 )); then echo "Count is less than 10"; fi
if (( num_files >= 100 )); then echo "Many files!"; fi

## Direct assignment within ((...))
(( result = a * b ))
```

### Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1009` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.

<summary><strong>ZC1010</strong>: Use `[[ ... ]]` instead of `[ ... ]` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh, `[[ ... ]]` is the preferred, more robust, and more feature-rich conditional construct compared to `[ ... ]` (which is typically an alias for the external `test` command or a shell built-in with similar behavior). The primary advantages of `[[...]]` include:

*   **Built-in Keyword:** `[[...]]` is a shell keyword, not an external command. This means it behaves more predictably and efficiently, without the overhead of invoking a separate process.
*   **Intelligent Word Splitting and Globbing:** `[[...]]` handles word splitting and pathname expansion (globbing) intelligently. You generally **do not need to quote variables** within `[[...]]` unless you specifically intend for literal string matching against patterns that could otherwise be interpreted as globs. This significantly reduces common scripting errors and improves robustness.
*   **Enhanced Features:** It offers Zsh-specific features and improved syntax:
    *   **Regular Expression Matching (`=~`):** Allows direct regex matching within the conditional.
    *   **Glob Pattern Matching:** Supports extended glob patterns without explicit glob qualifiers.
    *   **Logical Operators:** Uses C-style logical operators (`&&` for AND, `||` for OR) directly, avoiding the need for separate `-a` or `-o` flags which can have surprising precedence issues.

Using `[ ... ]` requires meticulous quoting of variables and expressions to prevent unintended word splitting and pathname expansion, which can lead to bugs, security vulnerabilities, or simply incorrect logic. For arithmetic comparisons, `((...))` is often more appropriate (see [[Katas/ZC1000-ZC1099/ZC1003 | ZC1003]]).

### Bad Example

```zsh
my_string="hello world"
if [ -n $my_string ]; then echo "This might incorrectly split arguments"; fi
## Fails if $my_string contains spaces (e.g., test -n hello world) or expands to a glob pattern

file_path="/path/to/my file.txt"
if [ -f $file_path ]; then echo "File exists"; fi # Will fail if file_path has spaces and is unquoted

## Complex logic with -a (prone to precedence issues)
if [ $a -gt 10 -a $b -lt 20 ]; then echo "Range"; fi
```

### Good Example

```zsh
my_string="hello world"
if [[ -n $my_string ]]; then echo "Correctly handles spaces and globs"; fi
## No quotes needed for $my_string here, `[[...]]` handles it robustly.

file_path="/path/to/my file.txt"
if [[ -f $file_path ]]; then echo "File exists"; fi # Safely handles spaces in file names

## Clearer logical operators
if [[ $a -gt 10 && $b -lt 20 ]]; then echo "Range"; fi

## Regular expression matching
if [[ "$version" =~ "^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$" ]]; then echo "Valid version format"; fi
```

<summary><strong>ZC1011</strong>: Use `git` porcelain commands instead of plumbing commands <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Git commands are broadly categorized into two main types:

*   **Porcelain commands:** These are high-level, user-friendly commands designed for common day-to-day operations (e.g., `git status`, `git commit`, `git pull`). Their output and behavior are generally stable across Git versions, making them reliable for scripting and user interaction.
*   **Plumbing commands:** These are low-level commands that interact directly with Git's internal data structures (e.g., `git hash-object`, `git cat-file`, `git update-index`). Their output and exact behavior can be more prone to change between Git versions, and they require a deeper understanding of Git's internals.

In typical shell scripts, it is **highly recommended to use porcelain commands** unless you have a very specific and well-understood need to interact with Git's internals. Relying on plumbing commands for common tasks can lead to fragile scripts that break with Git updates or are harder to understand and maintain.

### Bad Example

```zsh
## Using a plumbing command to get the current commit hash (less robust)
commit_hash=$(git rev-parse HEAD^{commit})

## Using an older or less direct method for current branch name

<summary><strong>ZC1012</strong>: Use `read -r` to prevent backslash escaping <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

When using the `read` built-in command in Zsh (and other shells), it's crucial to use the `-r` option (`raw` mode). By default, `read` interprets backslashes (`\`) as escape characters, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the input contains backslashes (e.g., file paths, special characters, or multi-line input). The `-r` option prevents `read` from interpreting backslashes, ensuring that the input is stored literally as it was entered. This significantly improves script robustness and predictability, especially when reading user input or arbitrary data from files.

### Bad Example

```zsh
read -p "Enter a string (e.g., C:\Program Files or line1\\nline2): " user_input
echo "You entered: $user_input"
## If user enters "C:\Program Files", it might be interpreted as "C:Program Files"
## If user enters "line1\\nline2", it might be interpreted as "line1\nline2"
```

### Good Example

```zsh
read -r -p "Enter a string (e.g., C:\Program Files or line1\\nline2): " user_input
echo "You entered: $user_input"
## "C:\Program Files" is stored exactly as entered, "line1\\nline2" is stored as "line1\nline2"
```

### Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1012` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.

<summary><strong>ZC1013</strong>: Use `((...))` for arithmetic operations instead of `let` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

While `let` is a built-in command for performing arithmetic operations and assignments, Zsh's `((...))` construct offers a more modern, idiomatic, and versatile C-style syntax for arithmetic. Preferring `((...))` over `let` brings several benefits:

*   **C-style Syntax:** `((...))` provides a familiar C-like syntax for arithmetic expressions, which is often more intuitive for developers coming from other programming languages.
*   **Versatility:** It can be used directly for both arithmetic evaluation (where its exit status is based on the result) and assignments, including compound assignments (`+=`, `-=`) and increment/decrement operators (`++`, `--`).
*   **Readability:** `((...))` makes arithmetic expressions clearer and more concise, especially for complex calculations or when integrating with conditional logic.
*   **Efficiency:** As a built-in shell feature, `((...))` is generally efficient.

`let` can sometimes be less readable, especially when expressions involve multiple variables or operators, and might require more careful quoting. This Kata encourages consistency and readability by promoting `((...))` for all C-style arithmetic needs.

### Bad Example

```zsh
count=0
let count=count+1      # Less idiomatic, requires re-typing variable name

total=10
price=2
quantity=5
let "total = price * quantity" # More verbose quoting for expressions

## Using let for comparison (often less clear)
if let "x < 10"; then echo "x is less"; fi
```

### Good Example

```zsh
count=0
(( count++ ))          # Concise C-style increment
(( count += 5 ))       # Compound assignment

total=10
price=2
quantity=5
(( total = price * quantity )) # Clean assignment

## Using ((...)) for comparison (clearer exit status)
x=5
if (( x < 10 )); then echo "x is less"; fi
```

### Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1013` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.

<summary><strong>ZC1014</strong>: Use `git switch` or `git restore` instead of `git checkout` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Git has introduced the specialized commands `git switch` and `git restore` to explicitly handle the distinct operations previously managed by the single, overloaded `git checkout` command. Adopting these newer commands offers significant benefits:

*   **Improved Clarity:** Each command now has a single, clear responsibility:
    *   `git switch`: Dedicated to changing branches.
    *   `git restore`: Dedicated to reverting modified files in the working tree or restoring files from the staging area.
*   **Reduced Ambiguity:** The original `git checkout` command had three main functions (switching branches, restoring working tree files, restoring staging index files), which could lead to confusion and accidental data loss. `git switch` and `git restore` eliminate this ambiguity.
*   **Modern Git Practices:** Using `git switch` and `git restore` aligns with current Git best practices, making scripts and workflows easier to understand and more resilient to future Git changes.

While scripts still using `git checkout` for these purposes remain functional, migrating to `git switch` and `git restore` improves readability, maintainability, and safety.

### Bad Example

```zsh
## Overloaded `git checkout` for switching branches
git checkout feature-branch

## Overloaded `git checkout` for discarding local changes (risky if not careful)
git checkout -- my_modified_file.txt

## Overloaded `git checkout` to restore a file from staging (less intuitive)
git checkout HEAD -- staged_file.txt
```

### Good Example

```zsh
## Clearer `git switch` for changing branches
git switch feature-branch

## Clearer `git restore` for discarding local changes in the working tree
git restore my_modified_file.txt

## Clearer `git restore` to unstage a file (restore from index to working tree, often implicit)
git restore --staged another_file.txt

## Restore a specific file from a commit (equivalent to checkout <commit> -- <file>)
git restore --source=HEAD~1 file_from_prev_commit.txt
```

<summary><strong>ZC1017</strong>: Use `print -r` to print strings literally <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

When printing arbitrary strings or variable contents, especially those that might contain backslashes (`\`) or other characters that `echo` could interpret as escape sequences, it is best practice to use `print -r`. The `print` builtin with the `-r` (raw) option ensures that backslashes are treated literally and not as escape characters. This guarantees that the output matches the input, preventing unintended interpretations or formatting issues. `echo`'s behavior can vary between shells and even different versions of the same shell, making `print -r` a more reliable and portable choice for literal output.

### Bad Example

```zsh
echo "Path: C:\Program Files"
echo -e "Hello\nWorld" # -e is an echo extension
```

### Good Example

```zsh
print -r "Path: C:\Program Files"
print -r "Hello\\nWorld" # Backslashes are printed literally
print "Hello\nWorld"    # print without -r interprets escapes
```

### Description

This Kata reinforces the use of Zsh's native `((...))` arithmetic construct over the external `expr` command. `((...))` is a powerful built-in that provides C-style arithmetic evaluation, integer comparisons, and variable assignments directly within the shell. It is generally more efficient than invoking an external `expr` command, which incurs process overhead. Furthermore, `((...))` syntax is cleaner and less prone to quoting issues that often plague `expr` expressions. Consistent use of `((...))` improves script performance, readability, and robustness.

### Bad Example

```zsh
value=$(expr $x \* $y + 5)
expr $i = $j > /dev/null
```

### Good Example

```zsh
value=$(( x * y + 5 ))

### Description

This Kata is a reinforcement of ZC1005. It re-emphasizes the importance of using the Zsh built-in `whence` over the external `which` utility. `whence` is superior because it accurately reports how a command will be found and executed by the shell, including considerations for aliases, functions, and built-ins. `which` only searches `PATH` for executable files, making it unreliable for determining the actual command Zsh will run. Preferring `whence` ensures that scripts accurately reflect Zsh's command lookup behavior.

### Bad Example

```zsh
which my_alias
## If 'my_alias' is an alias, 'which' won't show its definition
```

### Good Example

```zsh
whence my_alias

### Description

This Kata is a reinforcement of ZC1010. It reiterates the best practice of using Zsh's `[[ ... ]]` conditional command instead of the traditional `test` utility. `[[ ... ]]` is a shell keyword, providing superior safety and functionality. It automatically handles word splitting and globbing, preventing common errors that arise from unquoted variables in `test` or `[ ... ]`. Additionally, `[[ ... ]]` offers Zsh-specific features like regular expression matching and extended globbing patterns. Consistently using `[[ ... ]]` leads to more robust, readable, and less error-prone Zsh scripts.

### Bad Example

```zsh
if test -z "$var"; then echo "Var is empty"; fi
if test $num -eq 10; then echo "Num is 10"; fi

<summary><strong>ZC1021</strong>: Use symbolic permissions with `chmod` instead of octal <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

While octal notation (`755`, `644`) for `chmod` is concise, symbolic mode (`u+rwx`, `go=rx`) is often more readable, less error-prone, and clearer about the *intent* of the permission change, especially for complex adjustments. Symbolic mode allows you to add, remove, or set specific permissions for user, group, or others without needing to calculate the new octal value. This reduces the risk of accidentally granting unwanted permissions and makes scripts easier to understand for collaborators.

### Bad Example

```zsh
chmod 755 script.sh
chmod 600 config.txt
```

### Good Example

```zsh
chmod u=rwx,go=rx script.sh # Equivalent to 755

<summary><strong>ZC1030</strong>: Use `printf` instead of `echo` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

For printing formatted output, `printf` is generally superior and more portable than `echo` in Zsh (and other shells). `printf` provides precise control over output formatting through format specifiers (e.g., `%s` for string, `%d` for integer), handles escape sequences predictably, and prevents issues with variable expansion that `echo` might encounter. `echo`'s behavior can vary significantly between shells and even versions, making it less reliable for consistent output. Using `printf` ensures robust and predictable formatting.

### Description

For Zsh scripts, it is best practice to use `#!/usr/bin/env zsh` as the shebang line instead of a hardcoded path like `#!/bin/zsh` or `#!/usr/bin/zsh`. The `env` utility locates the `zsh` executable in the user's `PATH`, ensuring that the script uses the `zsh` version intended by the user, rather than a specific system-installed version that might not exist or be outdated on all systems. This significantly improves script portability across different environments.

<summary><strong>ZC1036</strong>: Prefer `[[ ... ]]` over `test` command <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

This Kata is another reinforcement of the best practice to use `[[ ... ]]` for conditional expressions in Zsh, instead of the older `test` command or single brackets `[ ... ]`. As a shell keyword, `[[ ... ]]` offers superior reliability by preventing issues with word splitting and globbing, and provides extended functionality like regular expression matching and robust pattern matching without complex quoting. Its consistent use makes Zsh scripts more resilient, readable, and aligned with modern shell scripting conventions.

### Bad Example

```zsh
if test -d /tmp; then echo "Dir exists"; fi
if [ -n "$VAR" ]; then echo "Var is set"; fi
```

### Good Example

```zsh
if [[ -d /tmp ]]; then echo "Dir exists"; fi

<summary><strong>ZC1037</strong>: Use `print -r --` for variable expansion <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

When printing the raw, uninterpreted value of a variable, especially one that might begin with a hyphen (`-`) or contain backslashes (`\`), it's best practice to use `print -r --`. The `-r` (raw) option prevents backslash interpretation, and the `--` argument explicitly signals the end of options, preventing any subsequent variable content that starts with a hyphen from being mistakenly parsed as another option to `print`. This ensures literal output and enhances script robustness against unpredictable variable content.

### Bad Example

```zsh
file_name="-my-file.txt"
echo $file_name # Could be interpreted as an option
print $file_name # Might interpret escapes
```

### Good Example

```zsh
file_name="-my-file.txt"
print -r -- "$file_name" # Prints literally, handles hyphens safely
```

<summary><strong>ZC1038</strong>: Avoid useless use of `cat` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

It's considered a bad practice, often called a "Useless Use of Cat" (UUOC), to use `cat` to pipe the content of a single file to another command when that command can read the file directly. This adds an unnecessary process to the pipeline, incurring overhead without providing any benefit. Many commands (e.g., `grep`, `sed`, `awk`) can accept a filename as an argument, making `cat file | command` redundant.

### Bad Example

```zsh
cat file.txt | grep "pattern"
cat another.log | sed 's/old/new/'
```

### Good Example

```zsh
grep "pattern" file.txt
sed 's/old/new/' another.log

<summary><strong>ZC1039</strong>: Avoid `rm` with root path <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Executing `rm` on the root directory (`/`) is extremely dangerous and can lead to irreversible data loss, rendering the system unusable. This Kata warns against using `rm` with `/` as an argument, even if other options like `-rf` are not explicitly present. While modern `rm` implementations often have built-in safeguards, relying on them is not a substitute for careful scripting. It's a critical safety measure to prevent accidental deletion of the entire filesystem.

### Bad Example

```zsh
rm -rf /
rm / # Even without -rf, this is dangerous
```

### Good Example

```zsh
rm -rf /tmp/my_dir
rm -rf ${MY_VAR}/subdir # Ensure MY_VAR is not "/"
```

<summary><strong>ZC1040</strong>: Use `(N)` nullglob qualifier for globs in loops <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh, if a glob pattern (like `*.txt`) does not match any files, it traditionally expands to itself (e.g., `*.txt`). This can lead to unexpected errors in loops or commands that assume a match. The `(N)` (nullglob) glob qualifier is a Zsh-specific feature that makes the glob expand to *nothing* if no matches are found, behaving more predictably in such scenarios. Using `(N)` ensures loops over globs don't mistakenly iterate over the literal pattern.

### Bad Example

```zsh
for file in *.txt; do # If no .txt files, loops once with literal "*.txt"
    echo "Processing $file"
done
```

### Good Example

```zsh
for file in *.txt(N); do # If no .txt files, loop is skipped

<summary><strong>ZC1041</strong>: Do not use variables in `printf` format string <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Using a variable directly as the format string in `printf` can be a security vulnerability, especially if the variable's content comes from untrusted input. Malicious input could inject format specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%n`) that might reveal stack contents, write to arbitrary memory locations, or cause a crash. Always use a static, literal string for the `printf` format and pass variables as separate arguments. If dynamic formatting is truly needed, sanitize the input or carefully construct the format string to prevent injection.

### Bad Example

```zsh
user_input="%s %s %s"
printf $user_input "hello" "world" # Vulnerable to format string attacks
```

### Good Example

```zsh
user_input="hello world"
printf "%s\n" "$user_input" # Safely prints the variable content
```

<summary><strong>ZC1042</strong>: Use "$@" to iterate over arguments <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

When iterating over all positional parameters (arguments passed to a script or function), it is best practice to use `"$@"`. This construct correctly preserves word boundaries and individual arguments, even if they contain spaces or special characters. Using `$*` (unquoted) or `$@` (unquoted) will typically cause word splitting, treating spaces within an argument as delimiters and leading to incorrect iteration. Always quote `"$@"` to ensure each argument is passed as a distinct word.

### Bad Example

```zsh
for arg in $*; do echo "Arg: $arg"; done # Splits arguments with spaces
for arg in $@; do echo "Arg: $arg"; done # Also splits
```

### Good Example

```zsh
for arg in "$@"; do echo "Arg: $arg"; done # Correctly preserves arguments
my_func() {
    for arg in "$@"; do
        echo "Function Arg: $arg"
    }

<summary><strong>ZC1043</strong>: Use `local` for variables in functions <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh (and other shells), variables defined within a function are global by default unless explicitly declared as local. This can lead to unintended side effects, where a function modifies a global variable with the same name, causing unexpected behavior in other parts of the script. Best practice dictates using the `local` keyword (or `typeset` for more options) to scope variables to the function, preventing name collisions and making functions self-contained and predictable.

### Bad Example

```zsh
global_var="hello"
my_func() {
    global_var="world" # Modifies global_var
    temp_var="inside"  # Also global by default
}
```

### Good Example

```zsh
global_var="hello"

    local global_var="world" # This is a new local variable
    local temp_var="inside"  # Scoped to function
}

<summary><strong>ZC1044</strong>: Check for unchecked `cd` commands <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

A `cd` command can fail for various reasons (e.g., directory does not exist, permission denied). If a `cd` command is not checked for success, subsequent commands in the script might operate in an unexpected directory, potentially leading to errors, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. It is crucial to always check the exit status of `cd` and handle potential failures, typically by exiting the script, returning from a function, or providing an error message.

### Bad Example

```zsh
cd /path/to/nonexistent_dir
rm * # This might now run in the wrong directory!
```

### Good Example

```zsh
cd /path/to/my_dir || exit 1 # Exit if cd fails
## Or in a function:
cd_safe() {
    cd "$1" || { print "Error: Cannot change to $1"; return 1; }

<summary><strong>ZC1045</strong>: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

When declaring and assigning a variable simultaneously on the same line (e.g., `local var=$(command)`), the exit status of the `command` might not be directly propagated to the `$?` variable of the outer shell. Instead, the exit status might reflect the success or failure of the `local` (or `typeset`) command itself, masking the actual success of the command substitution. To reliably capture the command's exit status, it's safer to perform the assignment in two separate steps: first execute the command, then assign its output to the variable.

### Bad Example

```zsh
local output=$(my_command)
if (( $? != 0 )); then echo "my_command failed"; fi # $? might be local's exit status
```

### Good Example

```zsh
output=$(my_command)
local output # Declare local after command execution
if (( $? != 0 )); then echo "my_command failed"; fi # $? is my_command's exit status
```

<summary><strong>ZC1046</strong>: Avoid `eval` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

The `eval` command executes its arguments as a shell command. While powerful, `eval` is extremely dangerous because it can introduce severe security vulnerabilities if its input is not fully trusted and sanitized. Malicious input can inject arbitrary commands, leading to remote code execution or other exploits. Due to these risks, `eval` should be avoided whenever possible. If dynamic command construction is unavoidable, consider safer alternatives like arrays for arguments or `printf %q` for quoting.

### Bad Example

```zsh
user_input="rm -rf /" # Imagine this came from user
eval "$user_input"   # Danger!
```

### Good Example

```zsh
## Avoid eval. Use explicit command structure.
## Example for dynamic command:
cmd=("ls" "-l")
if [[ $show_all = true ]]; then
    cmd+="-a"
fi
"${cmd[@]}" # Safe execution

<summary><strong>ZC1047</strong>: Avoid `sudo` in scripts <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Hardcoding `sudo` directly into scripts can be a security risk. It grants elevated privileges, often without explicit user consent or a clear understanding of the full impact of the elevated commands. This can lead to unintended system modifications, security vulnerabilities if the script is compromised, or unexpected behavior if the script's assumptions about the environment change. Scripts should ideally be run with the necessary privileges from the outset or prompt the user for `sudo` only when absolutely necessary and with clear warnings. If `sudo` is unavoidable, minimize its scope (e.g., `sudo command -arg`) rather than running an entire subshell with elevated privileges.

### Bad Example

```zsh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo sh -c 'echo "secret" > /etc/sensitive_file'
```

### Good Example

```zsh
## User runs script with sudo
## sudo ./install.sh

## Or prompt for sudo when necessary
if (( EUID != 0 )); then
    print "This script requires root privileges. Please run with sudo."
    exit 1

## Minimal sudo scope

<summary><strong>ZC1048</strong>: Avoid `source` with relative paths <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Using `source` (or `.`) with relative paths to include other script files can be problematic, especially in scripts that might change the current working directory (`cd`) or be invoked from different locations. A relative path for `source` is resolved *relative to the current working directory at the time `source` is executed*, not relative to the script containing the `source` command. This can lead to scripts failing to find their dependencies or sourcing unintended files. It's safer to use an absolute path or a path relative to the *script's own directory*, usually determined using `dirname $0` or similar techniques.

### Bad Example

```zsh
## script.sh
## inside script.sh:
source ./config.zsh # Might fail if script.sh is called from other dir
```

### Good Example

```zsh
## script.sh
## inside script.sh:
script_dir=$(dirname "${(%):-%x}") # Zsh-specific way to get script's dir
source "${script_dir}/config.zsh"

<summary><strong>ZC1049</strong>: Prefer functions over aliases <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

While aliases are convenient for short command shortcuts, functions offer superior flexibility, robustness, and readability in Zsh scripts and configurations. Functions allow for positional parameters (`$1`, `$2`), conditional logic, multiple commands, and local variables, making them much more powerful than simple text substitutions provided by aliases. Aliases can also interact unpredictably with quoting and command-line parsing. For anything beyond a trivial, single-word substitution, a function is the preferred choice for maintainability and predictable behavior.

### Bad Example

```zsh
alias ll="ls -lh" # Simple alias
alias commit_all="git add . && git commit -m 'Auto commit'" # Complex alias
```

### Good Example

```zsh
## Simple alias is acceptable for interactive use, but prefer function in scripts:
ll() { ls -lh "$@"; } # Function version of ll

commit_all() {
    git add .
    git commit -m "Auto commit" "$@"
}

<summary><strong>ZC1050</strong>: Avoid iterating over `ls` output <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Parsing the output of `ls` in a loop (e.g., `for file in $(ls)`) is highly unreliable and considered a bad practice. `ls` output is primarily designed for human readability, not machine parsing. Filenames can contain spaces, newlines, or special characters that will cause `for` loops (which typically split on whitespace) to misinterpret filenames, leading to incorrect processing or even unexpected command execution. Instead of `ls`, use globbing (`for file in *`) for simple file lists or `find` with `-print0` and `xargs -0` for robust, null-delimited processing of arbitrary filenames.

### Bad Example

```zsh
for file in $(ls *.txt); do
    echo "Processing $file"
done
```

### Good Example

```zsh
for file in *.txt; do # Uses globbing, handles spaces in filenames
    echo "Processing $file"
done

<summary><strong>ZC1051</strong>: Quote variables in `rm` to avoid globbing <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

When passing variable content to `rm`, especially if that content represents a filename, it is critical to quote the variable (e.g., `rm "$file"`) to prevent unintended globbing (pathname expansion). If a variable contains characters like `*`, `?`, or `[`, and it's unquoted, Zsh will attempt to interpret it as a glob pattern before passing it to `rm`. This can lead to deleting multiple files or the wrong files entirely if the variable's value happens to match existing files. Always quote variables when passing them as arguments to `rm` to ensure they are treated as literal filenames.

### Bad Example

```zsh
file_to_delete="backup-*.zip"
rm $file_to_delete # If "backup-*.zip" matches actual files, they'll be deleted
```

### Good Example

```zsh
file_to_delete="backup-*.zip"
rm "$file_to_delete" # Ensures only the literal "backup-*.zip" file is targeted

<summary><strong>ZC1052</strong>: Avoid `sed -i` for portability <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

The `-i` option of `sed` (for in-place editing) behaves differently across various `sed` implementations (e.g., GNU sed vs. BSD/macOS sed). Specifically, BSD `sed` requires a mandatory backup extension (e.g., `sed -i .bak`), while GNU `sed` allows `-i` without an extension (or `-i''` to explicitly avoid a backup). This discrepancy makes `sed -i` non-portable across systems. For cross-platform compatibility, it's safer to perform explicit redirection: write `sed`'s output to a temporary file, then move the temporary file over the original.

### Bad Example

```zsh
sed -i 's/foo/bar/' file.txt # Fails on BSD sed without backup extension
```

### Good Example

```zsh
## Portable in-place editing
sed 's/foo/bar/' file.txt > file.tmp && mv file.tmp file.txt

## If targeting specific sed (e.g., GNU sed on Linux only)
## sed -i'' 's/foo/bar/' file.txt # GNU compatible
## sed -i '.bak' 's/foo/bar/' file.txt # BSD compatible

<summary><strong>ZC1053</strong>: Silence `grep` output in conditions <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

When using `grep` within a conditional statement (e.g., `if grep ...`, `while grep ...`) to check for the existence of a pattern, its output to `stdout` is usually undesirable. The purpose of `grep` in such contexts is typically its exit status (0 for match, non-zero for no match or error), not the matching lines themselves. Redirecting `grep`'s output to `/dev/null` using `grep -q` (quiet mode) or `&>/dev/null` prevents cluttering the terminal or pipeline with extraneous information, improving script cleanliness and preventing unintended side effects if subsequent commands process `grep`'s `stdout`.

### Bad Example

```zsh
if grep "error" log.txt; then # Prints matching lines to stdout
    echo "Found errors!"
fi
```

### Good Example

```zsh
if grep -q "error" log.txt; then # -q suppresses stdout

<summary><strong>ZC1054</strong>: Use POSIX classes in regex/glob <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

When specifying character sets in regular expressions or glob patterns (e.g., with `grep`, `sed`, or Zsh's extended globbing), it's generally more portable and often clearer to use POSIX character classes (e.g., `[[:digit:]]`, `[[:alpha:]]`). These classes abstract character ranges based on locale and standards, ensuring consistent behavior across different systems. Using literal ranges like `[0-9]` or `[a-zA-Z]` might not always cover all expected characters in non-ASCII locales and can be less readable than their POSIX equivalents.

### Bad Example

```zsh
grep '[a-zA-Z0-9]' file.txt
ls *.[0-9] # Globbing for files ending in a digit
```

grep '[[:alnum:]]' file.txt

<summary><strong>ZC1055</strong>: Use `[[ -n/-z ]]` for empty string checks <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh (and other shells), the `[[ -n string ]]` and `[[ -z string ]]` constructs are the idiomatic and most reliable ways to check if a string is non-empty or empty, respectively. These operators are designed specifically for string length checks and handle various string contents (including empty strings, zero, or whitespace) predictably. Directly comparing a string to an empty string (e.g., `[[ "$var" = "" ]]`) works, but `-n` and `-z` are more concise and semantically clearer for this specific purpose.

### Bad Example

```zsh
if [[ "$VAR" = "" ]]; then echo "VAR is empty"; fi
if [[ ! "$VAR" = "" ]]; then echo "VAR is not empty"; fi
```

### Good Example

```zsh
if [[ -z "$VAR" ]]; then echo "VAR is empty"; fi

<summary><strong>ZC1056</strong>: Avoid `$((...))` as a statement <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh, `$(())` is primarily an *arithmetic expansion* used to substitute the result of a calculation into a command. It is not intended to be used as a standalone statement for its side effects (like variable assignment within the expression) or for its exit status. For C-style arithmetic statements or to leverage the exit status of an arithmetic expression, the `((...))` construct should be used. Using `$(())` as a statement can lead to confusion or subtle bugs, as its primary purpose is value substitution.

### Bad Example

```zsh
$(( i++ )) # Result is substituted but not used, might be confusing
$(( var = 1 + 2 )) # Assignment inside is typically not useful as a statement
```

### Good Example

```zsh
(( i++ )) # Correctly performs increment as a statement
result=$(( i + 1 )) # Correctly uses arithmetic expansion for substitution
```

<summary><strong>ZC1057</strong>: Avoid `ls` in assignments <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Assigning the output of `ls` to a variable (e.g., `files=$(ls)`) is unreliable and problematic. Similar to iterating over `ls` output (ZC1050), the output of `ls` is meant for human consumption and is not safely parsable by scripts, especially when filenames contain spaces, newlines, or special characters. These characters will cause word splitting and globbing issues when the variable is later expanded, leading to incorrect file handling. For safely storing lists of filenames, consider using arrays populated by globbing (`files=(*.txt)`) or by using `find` with null-delimited output.

### Bad Example

```zsh
files=$(ls)
for f in $files; do echo "$f"; done # Unreliable if filenames have spaces
```

### Good Example

```zsh
files=(*) # Populates array with filenames from current directory
for f in "${files[@]}"; do echo "$f"; done

<summary><strong>ZC1058</strong>: Avoid `sudo` with redirection <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Using `sudo command > file` for redirection is often problematic because the redirection (`> file`) is performed by the *unprivileged shell* running `sudo`, not by the `command` itself (which runs with elevated privileges). This means the unprivileged shell attempts to write to `file`, which will likely fail if `file` is in a restricted location. To write to a privileged location with `sudo`, the entire redirection operation needs to be executed by the privileged shell, typically by piping to `sudo tee` or using `sudo sh -c '...'`.

### Bad Example

```zsh
echo "content" > /etc/privileged_file # Fails if /etc is root-owned
sudo echo "content" > /etc/privileged_file # Still fails, redirection is unprivileged
```

### Good Example

```zsh
echo "content" | sudo tee /etc/privileged_file # Pipe to privileged tee
## Or for more complex operations:
sudo sh -c 'echo "content" > /etc/privileged_file' # Entire operation is privileged
```

<summary><strong>ZC1059</strong>: Use `${var:?}` for `rm` arguments <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

When `rm` is used with a variable that might expand to an empty string, it can unexpectedly try to delete the current directory or other critical locations, leading to data loss. The `${var:?message}` parameter expansion in Zsh (and POSIX shells) provides a crucial safeguard: if `var` is null or unset, the shell prints `message` to standard error and exits (or returns from the function, depending on context). This prevents `rm` from executing with an empty argument and ensures that important variables are defined before destructive operations.

### Bad Example

```zsh
dir_to_delete="$EMPTY_VAR"
rm -rf "$dir_to_delete"/temp_files # If EMPTY_VAR is unset, becomes "rm -rf /temp_files"
```

### Good Example

```zsh
dir_to_delete="${EMPTY_VAR:?Error: Directory variable is not set}"
rm -rf "$dir_to_delete"/temp_files # Exits if EMPTY_VAR is unset
```

<summary><strong>ZC1060</strong>: Avoid `ps | grep` without exclusion <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Using `ps | grep pattern` to find a specific process can lead to a "grep-for-grep" problem: `grep` itself might appear in the `ps` output, causing a false positive. This is particularly common if the pattern being searched for is part of the `grep` command line. To avoid this, it's best practice to exclude the `grep` process itself from the results. Common methods include using `grep -v grep` or a regex that makes the `grep` pattern unique (e.g., `[p]attern`).

### Bad Example

```zsh
ps aux | grep "my_script" # May match the grep command itself
```

### Good Example

```zsh
ps aux | grep "[m]y_script" # Excludes "grep my_script"
## Or:
ps aux | grep "my_script" | grep -v grep
```

<summary><strong>ZC1061</strong>: Prefer `{start..end}` over `seq` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh (and Bash 4+), brace expansion with ranges (e.g., `{1..10}`) is a highly efficient and idiomatic way to generate sequences of numbers or characters. This is a shell built-in feature, avoiding the need to invoke an external utility like `seq`. Using `seq` incurs the overhead of launching an external process, which can be slower, especially in loops. Brace expansion is generally faster, more convenient, and promotes native shell feature usage.

### Bad Example

```zsh
for i in $(seq 1 5); do echo $i; done
```

### Good Example

```zsh
for i in {1..5}; do echo $i; done
```

<summary><strong>ZC1062</strong>: Prefer `grep -E` over `egrep` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

The `egrep` command is largely deprecated. Its functionality, which is to interpret patterns as extended regular expressions (EREs), is fully encompassed by `grep -E`. Using `grep -E` promotes consistency across commands (`grep`, `grep -F`, `grep -G`), simplifies tooling, and avoids reliance on a separate executable that might not be available or have inconsistent behavior on all systems. This is a matter of modern best practice and command consolidation.

### Bad Example

```zsh
egrep 'word1|word2' file.txt
```

### Description

Similar to `egrep`, the `fgrep` command is largely deprecated. Its functionality, which is to interpret patterns as fixed strings (not regular expressions), is fully encompassed by `grep -F`. Using `grep -F` promotes consistency across `grep` variants, simplifies command recall, and avoids relying on a separate executable that might not be consistently available or behave identically across all systems. This is a best practice for modern shell scripting.

### Bad Example

<summary><strong>ZC1064</strong>: Prefer `command -v` over `type` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh (and other shells), `command -v` is the most robust and portable way to determine the full pathname or definition of a command, including handling aliases, functions, and built-ins. While `type` can provide similar information, its output format can vary more widely across shells, making it less suitable for programmatic parsing in scripts. `command -v` is specifically designed for reliable output in scripts and adheres to POSIX standards, ensuring consistent behavior.

### Bad Example

```zsh
type my_command # Output format can vary
```

### Good Example

```zsh
command -v my_command # Reliable output for scripting
```

<summary><strong>ZC1065</strong>: Ensure spaces around `[` and `[[` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In both Zsh and other POSIX-like shells, it is a strict requirement to have whitespace (spaces or tabs) around the `[` and `[[` constructs, as well as their closing `]` and `]]`. These are treated as commands or keywords, and without proper spacing, the shell will interpret them as part of adjacent words, leading to syntax errors or unexpected behavior. This is a fundamental rule for shell scripting.

### Bad Example

```zsh
if [condition]; then echo "Bad"; fi
if [[$var = "value"]]; then echo "Also bad"; fi
```

### Good Example

```zsh
if [ condition ]; then echo "Good"; fi
if [[ $var = "value" ]]; then echo "Also good"; fi

<summary><strong>ZC1066</strong>: Avoid iterating over `cat` output <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Iterating over the output of `cat` (e.g., `for line in $(cat file.txt)`) is an unreliable and inefficient practice, often referred to as a "Useless Use of Cat" (UUOC) combined with parsing issues. The `for` loop, by default, splits input on whitespace, meaning that lines containing spaces will be broken into multiple items, and empty lines might be skipped. Additionally, `cat` adds an unnecessary process to the pipeline. For iterating over lines, `while IFS= read -r` loop is the robust method. For iterating over filenames, globbing or `find -print0` is preferred.

### Bad Example

```zsh
for item in $(cat my_list.txt); do
    echo "Item: $item"
done
```

### Good Example

```zsh
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "Line: $line"
done < my_list.txt
```

<summary><strong>ZC1067</strong>: Separate `export` and assignment to avoid masking return codes <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

When you combine variable assignment and `export` on the same line (e.g., `export VAR=$(command)`), the exit status of the `command` might be masked by the exit status of the `export` builtin itself. This can lead to scripts incorrectly assuming success for `command` when it actually failed. To reliably capture the exit status of the command substitution, it's safer to perform the assignment first, then export the variable in a separate step.

### Bad Example

```zsh
export BUILD_ID=$(run_build_process)
if (( $? != 0 )); then echo "Build failed"; fi # $? might be export's exit status
```

### Good Example

```zsh
BUILD_ID=$(run_build_process)
if (( $? != 0 )); then echo "Build failed"; exit 1; fi
export BUILD_ID # Export after checking success
```

<summary><strong>ZC1068</strong>: Use `add-zsh-hook` instead of defining hook functions directly <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Zsh provides the `add-zsh-hook` function to manage hook functions (like `precmd`, `chpwd`, `preexec`) in a robust and extensible manner. Instead of directly defining a function with the hook's name (e.g., `precmd() { ... }`), which overwrites any existing hook, `add-zsh-hook` allows multiple functions to be registered for the same hook. This ensures compatibility with other Zsh configurations or plugins that might also define hooks, preventing unexpected behavior or lost functionality. It's a best practice for cooperative and modular Zsh configurations.

### Bad Example

```zsh
precmd() {
    echo "Running precmd hook" # Overwrites any previous precmd()
}
```

### Good Example

```zsh
my_precmd_function() {
    echo "Running my custom precmd hook"
}
add-zsh-hook precmd my_precmd_function # Adds to existing hooks
```

<summary><strong>ZC1069</strong>: Avoid `local` outside of functions <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

The `local` (or `typeset`) keyword is specifically designed to create function-local variables, limiting their scope to the function they are defined within. Using `local` outside of a function (e.g., directly in a script or in a subshell that is not a function body) has no effect on scope or can lead to unexpected behavior, as variables are typically global in script scope. This Kata aims to prevent the misuse of `local` and clarify variable scoping expectations, ensuring that developers correctly apply variable declarations based on their intended scope.

### Bad Example

```zsh
## In a script:
local script_var="hello" # Has no effect on scope
if true; then
    local if_var="world" # No effect, 'if' is not a function scope
fi
```

### Good Example

```zsh
## In a function:
my_func() {
    local func_var="hello" # Correctly scoped to my_func
}
## In a script, simply assign:
script_var="hello"
```

<summary><strong>ZC1070</strong>: Use `builtin` or `command` to avoid infinite recursion in wrapper functions <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

When you create a Zsh function that has the same name as an existing command (e.g., `ls() { ... }`), calling `ls` inside your function will recursively call your function, leading to infinite recursion and a stack overflow. To call the *original* `ls` command (or any other built-in/external command) from within a function that wraps it, you must use `builtin` or `command`. `builtin ls` executes the built-in version, and `command ls` searches the `PATH` for the external command, bypassing function lookups. This prevents infinite recursion and allows you to augment existing commands safely.

### Bad Example

```zsh
ls() {
    echo "My custom ls"
    ls "$@" # Infinite recursion!
}
```

### Good Example

```zsh
ls() {
    echo "My custom ls"
    command ls "$@" # Calls the external ls command
    # Or if ls is a builtin you want to extend:
    # builtin ls "$@"
}

<summary><strong>ZC1071</strong>: Use `+=` for appending to arrays <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Appending elements to a Zsh array using `array=($array new_element ...)` is generally less efficient and more verbose than using the `+=` operator. The `array=(...)` syntax re-creates the entire array, which can be slower for large arrays, while `array+=(...)` is optimized for appending and is more concise. This Kata promotes the idiomatic use of `+=` for array concatenation.

### Bad Example

```zsh
my_array=(element1 element2)
my_array=($my_array new_element) # Recreates array
```

### Good Example

```zsh
my_array=(element1 element2)
my_array+=(new_element) # Appends efficiently
```

### Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1071` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.

<summary><strong>ZC1072</strong>: Use `awk` instead of `grep | awk` <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

Piping the output of `grep` to `awk` (e.g., `grep pattern file | awk '{...}'`) is often inefficient because `awk` itself has powerful pattern matching capabilities. By combining the pattern matching directly within `awk` (e.g., `awk '/pattern/ { ... }' file`), you eliminate the need for an extra process in the pipeline, reducing overhead and improving performance. This is a common optimization for shell scripts.

```

### Good Example

```zsh

<summary><strong>ZC1073</strong>: Unnecessary use of `$` in arithmetic expressions <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen?style=flat-square" height="15"/></summary>

### Description

In Zsh's arithmetic contexts, specifically within `((...))` expressions, variables do not require a leading `$` to be evaluated for their numeric value. For example, `(( var > 0 ))` is sufficient; `(( $var > 0 ))` is redundant and can be confusing. The shell automatically dereferences variables within arithmetic contexts. Using `$` unnecessarily can clutter the code and deviate from idiomatic Zsh style. However, special parameters like `$#` (number of arguments) still require the `$` as they are not simple variables.

### Bad Example

```zsh
count=5
(( $count++ )) # $ is unnecessary here
if (( $my_var < 10 )); then echo "Low"; fi
```

### Good Example

```zsh
count=5
(( count++ ))
if (( my_var < 10 )); then echo "Low"; fi
if (( $# > 0 )); then echo "Args exist"; fi # $# still requires $
```

### Description

In Zsh, if a glob matches no files, it throws an error by default (`zsh: no matches found: ...`). When iterating over a glob in a `for` loop, use the `(N)` glob qualifier to allow it to match nothing (nullglob). This prevents the script from crashing or printing an error if the directory is empty.
