# Integrations

ZShellCheck is verified against the script corpora of these popular Zsh ecosystems.
Every release runs a parse + lint sweep over each — no panics, no crashes, deterministic output.
The list grows each release; the goal is 300+ corpora before v2.

## Summary

|   |   |
| ---: | :--- |
| **19** | corpora verified today |

## How the sweep runs

Each release tag triggers a parse + lint pass over every corpus listed in the **Featured** + per-category tables above.
Sandbox lives at `~/.config/zsh/zshellcheck/integration/` (local-only) and never touches the user's actual `~/.config/zsh` modules.
A run produces:

- `parse_errors` — total parser failures across the corpus.
- `violations` — total kata hits (all severities).
- A per-corpus markdown report under `~/.config/zsh/zshellcheck/integration/reports/`.

A bug surfaced by the sweep gets a GitHub issue, a PR fixes it, and the corpus stays in the matrix on every subsequent release.

## Adding an integration

If you maintain (or rely on) a popular Zsh project not listed above and want it covered by every release sweep, open an issue tagged `integration` with the repo URL and a short note on what it covers.
We add it to the next sweep and credit the request in the changelog entry.
